            <h1>Pet Facilities</h1>
            <p>Here at Pet Hotel we provide a safe place for your pets while you are away.</p>
            <p>Pet Hotel can arrange to have your dog groomed during their stay with us. Whether it is a full groom or just a wash & dry you require we can arrange to have it done prior to departure from the kennel. </p>
            <p>We can provide bedding, toys etc. we encourage pet owners to bring their own should they wish to, along with any comforters as we have found that it helps pets to settle in quicker when they have familiar belongings with them.</p>
            <p>We can arrange video calls between the pets and their owners, so you won’t miss your furry friend too much.</p>
            <p>OWe also provide a CCTV System to enable the hotel staff to keep a watchful eye on all pets from a monitoring room.</p>
            <p>We have also found that pets benefit from continuing their usual diet therefore we ask owners bring any special dietary food for the duration of their pets stay. Any instructions given regarding feeding routine will be adhered to and will be catered for.</p>
            <p>We also think it’s a good idea to introduce pets to each other as some pets as be territorial.</p>
            <p>Please note that we can also administer any medication required.</p>
